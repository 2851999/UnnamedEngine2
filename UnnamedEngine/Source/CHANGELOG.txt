* Fixed bug: Text in a GUITextBox would move vertically when
             a taller character was entered
* Fixed bug: GUISlider could be dragged when the mouse was
             clicked outside of the slider button
* Fixed bug: Calling onMousePressed() in a GUIComponent
             would have changed its clicked state to false if
             called twice

* NOTE: GUIComponents now have an enable/disable method which
        adds/removes their input listener from the current
        input manager, by default they are disabled, so
        enable() should be called on all objects that need

             when using keyboard keys

Release 0 | Beta 0 | Development 1 (V0.0.1)

'Well here we are again'. Another game engine attempt, worked
on over summer to test things for a computer science project,
although already a bit over the top.

Already has quite a lot of features as before, although some
major issues I didn't even realise the last 4 times including
the fact OpenGL uses column major matrices, which explains
a lot of difficulties in the past have been fixed. (facepalm)

Since starting the experimental branch, here are the changes:

* Added ResourceLoader
* Added GUICheckBox
* Added option for splash screen

* Renamed Audio to AudioManager

* Changed shadows so now change depending on the directional
  light's direction
