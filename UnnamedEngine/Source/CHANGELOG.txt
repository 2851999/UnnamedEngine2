Release 0 | Beta 1 | Development 2 (V0.1.0)

* Added Mouse
* Added Keyboard
* Added new Camera2D and 3D constructors
* Added getCursorPosition in Window
* Added save and load methods in InputBindings to allow input
  bindings to be saved/loaded from an ML file
  
* Changed DebugCamera's constructor to allow a custom
  InputBindings instance to be provided

* Moved Frustum.h to the experimental folder

* Removed Cubemap.h (Contents moved to Texture.h)
* Removed Cubemap.cpp (Contents moved to Texture.cpp)
* Removed the 'name' variable in PhysicsObject

* Fixed bug: InputBindings getButtonBinding and
             getAxisBinding methods caused a crash if the
             binding wasn't found
* Fixed bug: A high FPS meant that the delta would become 0,
             so it couldn't be used to regulate movement,
             this is now fixed but will mean that the FPS
             reading for PER_FRAME is not very accurate
             at high frame rates
* Fixed bug: Loading InputBindings would crash when a
             controller index didn't have any controller
             present
             
* Note: Started cleanup

  to and from files
* Added min() and max() to Vectors
* Added setCurrentStage() method in GUILoadingBar
* Added ability for GUIComponents to be attached to
  GUIComponents

* Renamed Scene to RenderScene3D

* Changed ResourceManager so that it now has instances of
  resource manager allowing greater control of when resources
  are released
* Changed Texture::loadTexture() to return NULL instead of an
  an empty Texture instance when an image can't be loaded
* Changed Shader so the current shader is stored, and a new
  one will only be used if necessary

* Fixed bug: GUIButton still displayed it's text when its
             visible property was set to false
* Fixed bug: GUICheckBox still displayed it's text when its
             visible property was set to false
* Fixed bug: ParticleEmitter wouldn't spawn particles if the
             delta * particleSpawnRate was < 1 in several
             frame
* Fixed bug: The VSync setting didn't have any effect
* Fixed bug: Weird font glitch 
* Fixed bug: InputBindingAxis could get stuck with a value
             when using keyboard keys
* Fixed bug: Sorting order for particles was wrong
* Fixed bug: ParticleSystem still a particle even though the
             particle count was 0
* Fixed bug: GUIComponent didn't check whether the mouse
             was hovering over it when it entered the window
* Fixed bug: GUILoadingBar still rendered it's fill even
             when visible was set to false
* Fixed bug: GUIComponents placed right next to each other
             could be selected at the same time

             divide by 0

             lines
* Fixed bug: Calling onMousePressed() in a GUIComponent
             would have changed its clicked state to false if
             called twice

* Note: RenderScene3D doesn't have an update method, so objects
        that move should always be updated manually/added
        to a PhysicsScene3D instance
* Note: GUIComponents now have an enable/disable method which
        adds/removes their input listener from the current
        input manager, by default they are disabled, so
        enable() should be called on all objects that need
        to receive input once created
* Note: Writing game using engine in the examples

'Well here we are again'. Another game engine attempt, worked
on over summer to test things for a computer science project,
although already a bit over the top.

Already has quite a lot of features as before, although some
major issues I didn't even realise the last 4 times including
the fact OpenGL uses column major matrices, which explains
a lot of difficulties in the past have been fixed. (facepalm)

Since starting the experimental branch, here are the changes:

* Added ResourceLoader
* Added GUICheckBox
* Added option for splash screen

* Renamed Audio to AudioManager

* Changed shadows so now change depending on the directional
  light's direction
