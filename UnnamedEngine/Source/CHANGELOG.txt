* Added GUIDropDownMenu
* Added GUIDropDownList
* Added GUIPanel
* Added GUIPanelGroup
* Added GUILabel
* Added GUISlider
* Added GUITextBox
* Added GUITextBoxCursor
* Added GUITextBoxSelection
* Added InputBinding
* Added InputBindingButton
* Added InputBindingAxis
* Added InputBindingsListener
* Added InputBindings
* Added DebugCamera
* Added Timer
* Added KeyboardShortcuts

* Added billboarded font support
* Added windowAspectRatio in Settings that is assigned when
  the Window is created
* Added methods to directly obtain the current frame delta
  in seconds
* Added loadFont method in ResourceLoader
* Added 'active' value in ParticleEmitter
* Added emitParticles() method in Particle emitter to
  activate a particle emitter to emit a specified number of
  particles
* Added methods to get input bindings given their name
* Added methods in SoundSystem to allow the listener to be
  moved after being created
* Added methods to pause/resume/stop all currently playing
  audio in SoundSystem
* Added methods to save and load the Settings structure
  to and from files
* Added min() and max() to Vectors
* Added setCurrentStage() method in GUILoadingBar
* Added ability for GUIComponents to be attached to
  GUIComponents

* Renamed Scene to RenderScene3D

* Changed ResourceManager so that it now has instances of
  resource manager allowing greater control of when resources
  are released
* Changed Texture::loadTexture() to return NULL instead of an
  an empty Texture instance when an image can't be loaded
* Changed Shader so the current shader is stored, and a new
  one will only be used if necessary
  
* Removed the overrideShader variable everywhere

* Fixed bug: GUIButton still displayed it's text when its
             visible property was set to false
* Fixed bug: GUICheckBox still displayed it's text when its
             visible property was set to false
* Fixed bug: ParticleEmitter wouldn't spawn particles if the
             delta * particleSpawnRate was < 1 in several
             frame
* Fixed bug: The VSync setting didn't have any effect
* Fixed bug: Weird font glitch 
* Fixed bug: InputBindingAxis could get stuck with a value
             when using keyboard keys
* Fixed bug: Sorting order for particles was wrong
* Fixed bug: ParticleSystem still a particle even though the
             particle count was 0
* Fixed bug: GUIComponent didn't check whether the mouse
             was hovering over it when it entered the window
* Fixed bug: GUILoadingBar still rendered it's fill even
             when visible was set to false
* Fixed bug: GUIComponents placed right next to each other
             could be selected at the same time
* Fixed bug: The length() method in vectors didn't stop a
             divide by 0
* Fixed bug: Font getHeight() didn't take into account new
             lines
* Fixed bug: Calling onMousePressed() in a GUIComponent
             would have changed its clicked state to false if
             called twice

* Note: RenderScene3D doesn't have an update method, so objects
        that move should always be updated manually/added
        to a PhysicsScene3D instance
* Note: GUIComponents now have an enable/disable method which
        adds/removes their input listener from the current
        input manager, by default they are disabled, so
        enable() should be called on all objects that need
        to receive input once created
* Note: Writing game using engine in the examples
