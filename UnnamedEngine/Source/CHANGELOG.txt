* Changed Renderer to only load shaders being used (can also
  use 'loadRenderShader' to load shaders manually)
* Changed MeshRenderData to assign specific attribute
  locations matching the ones defined in the shaders
* Changed shaders to use explicit locations (To make more
  compatible for compilation to SPIR-V)
* Changed MeshRenderData so 'setup' is not called and so must
  be done after creation (RenderData instance is now created
  in the constructor)
* Changed Material shaders to assign explicit binding locations
  for textures
* Changed Renderer to use texture units 10 and above when
  binding textures (to support old method of binding textures)
* Changed shader id's in Renderer to use unsigned integers
  instead of strings
* Changed 'loadEngineShader' in Renderer to load shaders for
  Vulkan in a separate folder 'shaders-vulkan'
* Changed 'videoVSync' in Settings to be an 'unsinged int'
  type so a value of 2 can be used to indicate triple
  buffering should be used (Vulkan)
* Changed 'setup' methods in RenderData to require a
  RenderShader instead of a Shader
* Changed 'initPerspective' in Matrix4f to return a
  different matrix when using Vulkan (so depth values are
  in the range 0-1 as Vulkan requires)
* Changed 'DEFAULT_CLAMP' in TextureParameters to be GL_REPEAT


* Cleaned up some shaders

* Improved accuracy of FPSLimiter
* Improved Audio to include loop intervals and a way to
  request a looping sound to stop
  
* Increased maximum number of bones in a model from 80 to 90

* Replaced all instances of std::map with std::unordered_map
  as the order was not necessary

* Renamed all utility namespaces from things like StrUtils
  to utils_string, and FileUtils to utils_file
* Renamed cutoff to innerCutoff in Light
* Renamed FramebufferTexture to FramebufferStore
* Renamed find to findChild in MLElement
* Renamed Sprite2D to Sprite
* Renamed 'timeBetweenFrame' to 'timeBetweenFrames' in
  Animation2D
  
* Removed 'shouldClamp' in TextureParameters (since default
  is GL_REPEAT anyway)
  
* Moved some of the shaders around

* Removed BoundingSphere structure (Replaced with sphere)
* Removed size parameter for SkyBox

* Fixed bug: Frustum culling did not take into account the
             scale of the object
* Fixed bug: Shadow's would repeat themselves if far enough
             away
* Fixed bug: DebugCamera was incorrectly calculating mouse
             movement
* Fixed bug: GUIDropDownMenu and hence GUIDropDownList did
             not assign added button's transform
* Fixed bug: Horizontal GUISlider did not work correctly
* Fixed bug: Matrix4f used half the value it should have for
             the fov
* Fixed bug: Shininess value was not loaded from materials
* Fixed bug: Was incorrectly calculating spot lights
* Fixed bug: Parallax disaplcement mapping was wrong when
             objects were rotated (seems like bitangents from
             assimp may be in the wrong direction)
* Fixed bug: Radius for the bounding sphere of a mesh was
             calculated incorrectly
* Fixed bug: MLDocument incorrectly delt with elements that
             were closed on the same line
* Fixed bug: TextureAtlas would not work properly with
             non-square textures
* Fixed bug: AudioLoader incorrectly loaded stereo sounds
* Fixed bug: Potential OpenAL crash upon failure to find a
             device
* Fixed bug: Font 'getWidth' could cause a segmentation fault
             with '\n' in the text
* Fixed bug: Font getHeight only measured the height of one
             line if \n was included
* Fixed bug: Rotations for skeletal animation weren't
             interpolated correctly
* Fixed bug: Depth sorting for particles ignored the last
  			 particle
* Fixed bug: Didn't delete 'vboOthers' in MeshRenderData
* Fixed bug: Fonth had overlapping glyphs in the bitmap
             resulting in lines appearing in text
* Fixed bug: Font didn't destroy the texture it created when
             it was destroyed
* Fixed bug: Didn't unbind depth buffer when creating a
             FramebufferStore
* Fixed bug: 'Renderer::destroy' was never called by
             BaseEngine
* Fixed bug: DebugCamera assigned 'A' and 'D' key bindings
             the wrong way round
* Fixed bug: Loaded RenderShaders were not destroyed by
             Renderer
* Fixed bug: Did not delete VBO's used for skinning in
             MeshRenderData

* Started adding Vulkan support
             
* Note: Text handles rendering of a Font instead of Font
