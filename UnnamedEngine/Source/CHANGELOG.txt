Release 0 | Beta 0 | Development 1 (V0.0.1)

'Well here we are again'. Another game engine attempt, worked
on over summer to test things for a computer science project,
although already a bit over the top.

Already has quite a lot of features as before, although some
major issues I didn't even realise the last 4 times including
the fact OpenGL uses column major matrices, which explains
a lot of difficulties in the past have been fixed. (facepalm)

Since starting the experimental branch, here are the changes:

* Added ResourceLoader
* Added GUICheckBox
* Added option for splash screen

* Renamed Audio to AudioManager

* Changed shadows so now change depending on the directional
  light's direction

* Just some general clean up/organising for development on
  two computers

* Renamed Audio to AudioManager
