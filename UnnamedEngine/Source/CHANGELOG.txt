Release 0 | Beta 0 | Development 3 | Experimental 5

* Added 'active' value in ParticleEmitter
* Added emitParticles() method in Particle emitter to
  activate a particle emitter to emit a specified number of
  particles
* Added methods to get input bindings given their name

* Fixed bug: Sorting order for particles was wrong

* More asteroids development

Release 0 | Beta 0 | Development 3 (V0.0.3)

* Added DebugCamera
* Added billboarded font support
* Added windowAspectRatio in Settings that is assigned when
  the Window is created
* Added methods to directly obtain the current frame delta
  in seconds
  
* Renamed Scene to RenderScene3D

* Fixed bug: ParticleEmitter wouldn't spawn particles if the
             delta * particleSpawnRate was < 1 in several
             frame
* Fixed bug: The VSync setting didn't have any effect
* Fixed bug: Weird font glitch 
* Fixed bug: InputBindingAxis could get stuck with a value
             when using keyboard keys
             
* Note: RenderScene3D doesn't have an update method, so objects
        that move should always be updated manually/added
        to a PhysicsScene3D instance

Release 0 | Beta 0 | Development 1 (V0.0.1)

'Well here we are again'. Another game engine attempt, worked
on over summer to test things for a computer science project,
although already a bit over the top.

Already has quite a lot of features as before, although some
major issues I didn't even realise the last 4 times including
the fact OpenGL uses column major matrices, which explains
a lot of difficulties in the past have been fixed. (facepalm)

Since starting the experimental branch, here are the changes:

* Added ResourceLoader
* Added GUICheckBox
* Added option for splash screen

* Renamed Audio to AudioManager

* Changed shadows so now change depending on the directional
  light's direction

* Just some general clean up/organising for development on
  two computers

* Renamed Audio to AudioManager
